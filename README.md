<h1>Hello! I am Francesco Buscicchio 🖖</h1>
  
I'm a developer with over two years of experience in the automotive sector. During my career I have worked with several frameworks including <b>WPF<b/> and <b>Angular</b>, and I have specialised in <b>C#, Javascript, SQL and Typescript languages</b>.

In addition, outside of my job, I have developed several personal projects. My main project at the moment is <b>🌱🌍EcoGram🌍🌱</b> (developed in Flutter) , a social network focused on saving the planet. Users are invited to actively participate in specific tasks to unlock additional features of the application and obtain rewards. ♻️

I am always looking for new projects to develop and new technologies to learn. 👨‍💻
I am passionate about technology and want to continue to improve my skills as a developer. 🔝
